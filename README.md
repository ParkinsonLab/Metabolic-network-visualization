# Metabolic-network-visualization
Example visualizations of metabolic networks created by Parkinson lab members

*Brugia malayi* (by Nirvana Nursimulu)

(1) Full metabolic network of the parasitic worm, showing different compartments (cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and Wolbachia).  
The network is coloured by pathway.  Reactions are circles, and (smaller) diamonds represent metabolites.

*Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa* (by Nirvana Nursimulu)

(1) Full combined metabolic network of both worms.  Coloured by pathways.  Diamonds are reactions, and circles represent metabolites.
(2) Depiction of differences in purine metabolism between both worms.  
More details in Cotton et al. (2016)  "The genome of Onchocerca volvulus, agent of river blindness." Nature Microbiology. 2:16216.

*Sarcocystis neurona* (by Nirvana Nursimulu)

(1) Impact of deleting reactions in energy production (glycolysis and the TCA cycle) on growth under different uptake conditions.
More details in Blazejewski et al. (2015)  "Systems based analysis of the Sarcocystis neurona genome identified patways that contribute to a heteroxenous life cycle." mBio. 6(1). pii: e02445-14.

*Toxoplasma gondii (iCS382)* (by Carl Song)

(1) Full metabolic network, coloured differently to show evidence attributed to reactions.  Diamonds are reactions, and circles represent metabolites.
More details in Song et al.  (2013)  "Metabolic reconstruction identifies strain-specific regulation of virulence in Toxoplasma gondii."  Molecular Systems Biology.  9:708.
